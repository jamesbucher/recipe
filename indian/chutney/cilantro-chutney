Version .1
Notes: Way Too spicy could not taste cilantro well (this was due to jalapeno)
Way Too salty (definately use no more than 1/2 tsp of salt)
Needs more cilantro than one bunch (did not mesure)
1/2 onion was probably too much
could probably use more vinegar or lemon juice


Cilantro - 1 Bunch
6 Nacho Slices jalapeno (WAS TOO MUCH)
1 tsp lemon juice
1 chunk ginger fresh
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp oil
1/2 onion (could probably be less)
juice 1/2 lime
1 tsp sugar (added another, tasted better but may be due to covering up excess salt)
1 large clove garlic
1 tsp salt (WAY TO MUCH)

Procedure:
Add all ingredients but cilantro to a food processor, blend well. Add cilantro and blend until smooth.
